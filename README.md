SkyPin - Put a couple of push pins on a map and find some flights!
==========

	With this app, users can find flights based on two pushpin locations. The first pushpin is placed by double clicking on or near an airport listed on the map. This is the airport from which the flight will originate. Scroll or zoom to another airport and double click to place a second pin. SkyPin will then query the local datastore for will request flight information from a list of airlines. The data will be returned as flight paths drawn onto the map using KML. The colors intensity of the routes will correspond with flight price. Connecting airports along the path will also be shown. Links will be availble to purchase the tickets from the host airport's payment processing system.
